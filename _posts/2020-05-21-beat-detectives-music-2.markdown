## Beat Detectives – _Music 2_ (2013)

_There is a place you go._ Not a place _I_ go, not a place _we_ go, but a place _you_ go. Go! Ride the subway, take a car, ride your bike, fly. A post-nightlife dreamscape, a burned-out basement or a castle in the stars, a utopic vision of a world without lines for clubs, crappy DJs, or assholes. Yeah, that's the place. Everyone's laughing and everything's funny, even if it's not. _Crazy people. Deeper web._ Go! It's the pinnacle of urban cool, of the new psychedelic. It's an antidote to the now and it's everything now. _Universal consciousness. Trapped in reality._ Dance over a bridge, climb a skyscraper. _Walking down the street._ Twenty seconds of it will make up for a hundred shitty songs, so let it all roll off your back. _There is a place you go._ Don't be scared – go! That place you go, you go there because you can, because you've earned it, because it's a place only you can go. Go!
