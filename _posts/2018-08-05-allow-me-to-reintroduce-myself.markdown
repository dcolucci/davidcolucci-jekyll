_"David Colucci - Web developer in NYC"._

That's what it said in the upper left corner of the former davidcolucci.com. A terse exposition of identity: the careful positioning as a web developer no doubt an artifact of the imposter syndrome of a nascent software engineering career, and the explicit geographic framing of this endeavor betraying an endearing pride in the city I'd then lived in for six years. By then, in 2014, New York City had well since established itself as a destination for consumers and suppliers of tech jobs (and the recruiters in between), so it seemed wise to advertise my locale prominently. But in my plunge into an industry whose growth in the city had felt in some ways a deliberate geographic statement -- i.e., as an opposite-coast answer to Silicon Valley -- I felt my bond to the city deepening. I became more invested in it, more a part of it. I felt a pride in that.

As for my self-professed status as a "web" developer, I suppose it wasn't too far off the truth, and in spirit may not be now either. Yet even allowing for a range of experience and skills as a term it feels a bit antiquated. In its strictest definition, The (title-cased) Web probably encompasses HTML documents that browsers retrieve from interconnected servers and render as user interfaces; surely there still is, and will be for the foreseeable future, strong demand for the skills to create such interfaces. But even the most novice of "front-end engineers" and whatever else we choose to call ourselves must take heed of the blurry and capricious ways of the digitized world. Websites exist as a medium for communication, but people don't use them the way they used to -- much less do we communicate the way we used to. As developers we must embrace fluidity, modularity, portability, and platform agnosticism.

So here we are in 2018 and I'm relaunching my personal website. No longer do I brand myself as a "web" developer; ever the more do I brand myself as an NYC resident. The pride I felt in my city and industry has grown but also changed: both have the potential to be positive forces in a world whose need for such has morphed dramatically since 2014. In launching a new site I've created a platform for self-expression, and through whatever ink I spill, bile I spew, praise I bestow, or inconsequential minutiae I belabor, I aim for davidcolucci.com to be a positive force in the world.
