# About me

I'm a professional technology leader living and working in New York City. A native of Ithaca, NY and graduate of its own Cornell University, I've lived in NYC for about 15 years. My lifelong fascination with technology has enabled me to move through a handful of industries and think about how people interact with technology from different angles.
