# About me

I'm a professional technology leader living and working in New York City. A native of Ithaca, NY and graduate of its own Cornell University, I've lived in NYC for about 15 years. My lifelong fascination with technology has enabled me to move through a handful of industries and think about how people interact with technology from different angles.

Outside of work I enjoy cycling, photography, making omelets and morning runs. I collect records and love supporting musical artists and labels directly on Bandcamp. I try to stay involved in my community by volunteering with various organizations ([Tech For Campaigns](https://www.techforcampaigns.org/); [The Marcy Lab School](https://www.marcylabschool.org/)) and supporting local businesses.
